/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * Use this file to specify configuration settings for use while developing
 * the app on your personal system: for example, this would be a good place
 * to store database or email passwords that apply only to you, and shouldn't
 * be shared with others in your organization.
 *
 * These settings take precedence over all other config files, including those
 * in the env/ subfolder.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *    local.js is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git
 *    as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *    this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *    Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *    machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *    (like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *    of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
 *    In a production environment, you probably want to leave this file out
 *    entirely and leave all your settings in env/production.js
 *
 *
 * For more information, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation/reference/sails.config/sails.config.local.html
